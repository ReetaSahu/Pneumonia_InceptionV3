# Hyperparameter Choices for Pneumonia Detection using Inception-V3

1. Learning Rate:
   - Initial phase: 0.0001 (1e-4)
     Rationale: Small enough for stable convergence during feature extraction.
   - Fine-tuning phase: 0.00001 (1e-5)
     Rationale: Lowered learning rate to prevent disrupting pretrained weights.

2. Batch Size:
   - Value: 32
   - Reason: Balanced trade-off between training speed and memory usage.
     Works well with Inception-V3 on most GPUs or Colab TPUs.

3. Epochs:
   - Phase 1: 10 epochs (feature extractor)
   - Phase 2: 5 epochs (fine-tuning top Inception-V3 layers)
   - Rationale: EarlyStopping prevents overfitting, model usually converges early.

4. Dropout:
   - Values: 0.5 and 0.3
   - Purpose: Regularization to reduce overfitting due to limited dataset size.

5. Optimizer:
   - Adam: Adaptive learning rate optimization, widely used in CNN tasks.

6. Loss Function:
   - Binary Crossentropy: Appropriate for binary classification (Normal vs Pneumonia).

7. Metrics:
   - Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall: Chosen to reflect medical relevance and handle class imbalance.

8. Class Weights:
   - Computed from training set to mitigate class imbalance.

9. Data Augmentation:
   - Techniques: Rotation, Zoom, Shift, Horizontal Flip
   - Purpose: Improves generalization by simulating real-world variation.
(we did not use data agumentation but for more accurate model it good to do.)
